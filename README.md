# Python_task1
Convert the **OS-based** program into a **Menu-Driven** program using python code which will execute the required user query when user will give the input as a text.
# There are 2 lib,we are using here:
## Pyttsx3
Pyttsx3 is a Python Library for **Text to Speech** conversion.Pyttsx is completely offline and works seemlesly and has multiple tts-engine support.
**Note-** pyttsx3 library now works for both python2 and python3 and is also a cross-platform.
## Installation
Use the package manager **[pip]** to install pyttsx3.
```bash
pip install pyttsx3
```
## Usage:
```python
import pyttsx3
pyttsx3.speak("Welcome to my tools")
```
## OS Library
The main purpose of this **OS Module** is to interact with your operating sysytem.
The OS module is a part of the standard library, or stdlib, within python3.This means it comes with your python installation, but you still must to import it.
## How to import it
```bash
import os
```
## Conclusion:
In this task, i have done that how, we can create a menu-driven os based program by using menu list in the top and accordigly it works.
User can put the query for whatever they want from that list specification by using text.
Then sysytem will process their query and run it and also if user doesn't want anything then they can simply quit or stop it.
Thats the way this task is running.
